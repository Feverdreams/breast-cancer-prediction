### Descrtion of topics plan to investigate

1. ***10-year survival***. Measure the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Area-Under-Curve (AUC)
   of binary classification of patients surviving longer than 10 years.
2. ***Rank-ordering of events.*** Measure the concordance between predicted risks of patients,
   and the rank-ordering of death events using Concordance Index (CI) 

### Methods and tools plan to use

1. programming language: python3.6, pandas, sklearn
2. Data preprocessing
   1. For clinical data:
   2. For genomic data:
3. Stretch algorithms:
   1. L1-regularized logistic regression for large datasets
   2. XGBoost
   3. Exotic neural networks - something that is not ready-made in TensorFlow
4. Evaluation



### Timeline for project milestones

1. Project Plan - 2/18
2. Developping the model - 2/18 - 3/30
3. Finish the report - 4/1-5/1
