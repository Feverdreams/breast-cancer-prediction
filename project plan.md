### Descrtion of topics plan to investigate

1. ***10-year survival***. Measure the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Area-Under-Curve (AUC)
   of binary classification of patients surviving longer than 10 years.

2. ***Rank-ordering of events.*** Measure the concordance between predicted risks of patients,
   and the rank-ordering of death events using Concordance Index (CI) 

   

### Methods and tools plan to use

1. programming language: python3.6, pandas, sklearn

2. Data preprocessing

   1. For clinical data:

      1. Import data by pandas
      2. Deal with categorical data by one-hot encoding
      3. Deal with missing data and value by deleting the samples  with missing value
      
   2. For genomic data:

      

3. Baseline methods in sklearn:

   1. Logistic Regression

   2. Support Vector Machines
   3. Decision Tree Algorithm
   4. Random Forest Classification

4. Stretch algorithms:

   1. L1-regularized logistic regression for large datasets 
   2. XGBoost 
   3. Exotic neural networks - something that is not ready-made in TensorFlow 
   4. More ..,

5. Model selection and Validation
